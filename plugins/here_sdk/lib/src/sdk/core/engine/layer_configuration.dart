/// A class to configure which layers should be enabled or disabled in the OCM map data.
///
/// Disabling a layer allows to reduce the amount of data that will be
/// downloaded or prefetched from the internet, for example, when panning the map view online or when downloading maps for offline use.
///
/// `LayerConfiguration` changes made via [SDKOptions] require `sdk.maploader.MapUpdater` to align previously downloaded content.
/// To ensure that the changes in [SDKOptions] affect the map data,
/// it is recommended to trigger a feature update or a map update. Without calling `mapUpdater.performFeatureUpdate(...)` or `mapUpdater.updateCatalog(...)`,
/// the adjustments will apply only to future map downloads and will not impact the currently installed map data, either in the cache or in the persisted storage.
/// Note that calling `performFeatureUpdate(...)` will preserve the current map version, even
/// when no map data update is available in the catalog. Calling `updateCatalog(...)` will
/// update the version, only when a map update is available in the catalog.
///
/// **Notes**
/// - The `LayerConfiguration` is only applicable for HERE SDK editions that contain the offline maps
///   feature such as the _Navigate Edition_. It has no effect on other editions.
/// - Only "OFFLINE_SEARCH", "OFFLINE_ROUTING", "TRUCK", "NAVIGATION", "RENDERING", "DETAIL_RENDERING" are enabled, by default. All other layers are disabled, by default.
///   Note that the "RENDERING" layer is a base layer that cannot be disabled: Therefore, it is not
///   necessary to explicitly add the layer to a feature configuration - it will be always enabled.
/// - The `LayerConfiguration` cannot be set separately for a region, it will be applied globally
///   for all regions that will be downloaded in the future.
/// - It is not possible to specify a separate `LayerConfiguration` for the map cache and offline maps.
///   The `LayerConfiguration` will be always applied to both.
/// - If a `LayerConfiguration` is applied, then only the listed features will be enabled,
///   all others will be disabled. For example, if you want to
///   disable only one feature, then all other features need to be present, or they will be also disabled.
///
/// The `LayerConfiguration` controls which content will be subject of
/// - map download and explicit prefetching for features in `enabledFeatures()`,
/// - implicit prefetching, such as when displaying a map view for features in `implicitlyPrefetchedFeatures()`.
